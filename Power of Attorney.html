In the realms of the spirit, knowledge is key, knowledge is POWER.
The devil perfectly understands this and uses it greatly to his advantage against man.

When you are not yet saved, the devil does everything within his reach to stop you from having the KNOWLEDGE OF GOD; the reason is, those who know their God shall be strong and do exploits.
But when you are lucky to get saved, the devil then embarks on massive war to prevent you from having good knowledge of your RIGHTEOUS IDENTITY IN CHRIST; he knows that in Christ, there is no limit to what you can do.

The place of the believer in Christ is AWESOME. When you are saved, you are enclosed in Christ, His identity covers you. This means you carry in you the powers of Christ and can do on this earth EVERYTHING He would have done if He were physically present here today.

Christ has given to every believer a LASTING POWER OF ATTORNEY.
A power of attorney (POA) is an authorization to represent or act on another's behalf. This is the place of the Christian in Christ and the reason He does not take one out of this world once you are saved. The believer is of Christ, in Christ and is to act on behave of Christ on this earth. For this, He has given us the keys of the kingdom, the power to overcome all forces of the evil one.

"I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you."- (Luke 10:19)

Therefore, don't let the devil intimidate you; you can do ALL things through Christ. Just hold unto Him in faith, declare His word with faith to exercise your power. As a Christian, You are an AMBASSADOR, stand up in faith represent Him well.</main>
